Snake Water Gun Game 🐍💧🔫
This is a basic game built using Python while I am learning Python programming.
I created this project to practice concepts like conditional statements, dictionaries, functions, and random number generation.
Building small projects like this helps me improve my coding skills, understand logic better, and gain confidence in Python.
This project is simple but very useful for beginners who want to learn Python through hands-on practice.
